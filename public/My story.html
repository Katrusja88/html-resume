<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  When I moved to Sweden in my 20th, I began to study Swedish and Logistics.
  Gothenburg (the city where I live) is a port city, and I figured that I would
  always be employed with this sort of education.

  Years went by and in general I enjoyed the world of shipping, but I was
  longing for tech more and more. I fell in love with UX design when I first
  came across it and immediately started studying again. After graduation I have
  worked in several companies (mostly startups) as a UX/UI Designer.

  To understand better developers, I decided to take a course in Web Development
  and this website is a product of the skills I have learnt (and still learning)
</p>

  On a personal note, my biggest hobby is traveling. There was a year when I
  visited 10 countries in 10 months! (not bragging!)
